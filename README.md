Make a README file on how to run the code
 All source code
 Testing/validation data (or download links if files are large)
 Pretrained models (if applicable)
 Make your GitHub page public
 Tag a release (e.g., v1.0-report-version), so the grader knows exactly which code state corresponds to the submission
