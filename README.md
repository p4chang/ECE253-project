To apply the image processing techniques to the images, we simply run runPipeline.m by uncommenting/commenting out the corresponding image processing technique as needed. Then we also modify the enhancementCategory to the output file names as desired. Here are the [Testing/validation data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WNtBGoE5hpt5G9ctnq9GOtIGLZfVIWKQ?usp=sharing), which includes both the original images and the zipped files of images after image processing is applied.

 how to run the code

 Pretrained models (if applicable)

 Tag a release (e.g., v1.0-report-version), so the grader knows exactly which code state corresponds to the submission
